# Arizona Election Shapefiles
This shapefile was obtained from Garret Archer, Data Analyst with the Arizona Secretary of State, and processed by members of the Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group (MGGG).

## Sources
The precinct shapefile is made available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/azsecretaryofstate/arizona-statewide-precinct-shapefile?select=az_vtd_2018_new_pima.shp) by Garret Archer, formerly Senior Elections Analyst with the Arizona Secratary of State and currently a Data Analyst with ABC15 Arizona. Tabular election data are from the [MIT Election Data Science Lab](https://electionlab.mit.edu). Block level demographic data for the 2010 Decennial Census were retrieved using the [Census API](https://api.census.gov/data/2010/dec/sf1).

## Processing
Some very limited merging of precincts in the original shapefile was necessary to join election results. La Paz County precincts were edited to match data provided on the county's [election website](http://www.co.la-paz.az.us/DocumentCenter/View/76/Precinct-Map-PDF). Demographic data were aggregated from the block level using MGGGâ€™s [proration software](https://github.com/mggg/maup). Congressional and state legislative district IDs were assigned to precincts also using this package.
